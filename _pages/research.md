<span style="color:CornflowerBlue">[A Differential Geometric View and Explainability of GNN on Evolving Graphs](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=lRdhvzMpVYV)</span>  
   <sup>**Yazheng Liu**, Xi Zhang, Sihong Xie <br>
   ***International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2023*** <br>
  We embed the manifold of GNN predicted distributions and devise the convex optimization to select important paths to explain the evolving graphs in the GNN.

<span style="color:CornflowerBlue">[Trade less Accuracy for Fairness and Trade-off Explanation for GNN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10020318/)</span>  
   <sup>**Yazheng Liu**, Xi Zhang, Sihong Xie <br>
   ***Second International Workshop on Data science for equality, inclusion and well-being challenges, Bigdata workshop, 2022*** <br>
We define a novel upper bound of group fairness to optimize the adjacency matrix for fairness without significantly harming prediction accuracy. We further propose  explanation methods to reveal the trade-offs and the space that one can exploit.
