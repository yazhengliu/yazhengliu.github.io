<span style="color:CornflowerBlue">[A Differential Geometric View and Explainability of GNN on Evolving Graphs](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=lRdhvzMpVYV)</span>  
   <sup>**Yazheng Liu**, Xi Zhang, Sihong Xie <br>
   ***International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2023*** <br>
  We embed the manifold of GNN predicted distributions and devise the convex optimization to select important paths to explain the evolving graphs in the GNN.
